                        I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.
                         I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. 
                         I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face,
                          I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, 
                          I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.</p>
                          
                          <p>I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, 
                          leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, 
                          I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, 
                          I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies.
                           I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
